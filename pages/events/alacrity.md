A Photography Contest is a platform to showcase your talent. While clicking away just for the sake of photography is a lot of fun, sometimes a contest can help you raise the bar as a photographer. Especially when you know your image will be seen by a discerning group of judges, and then possibly displayed alongside those of other winners.

SANKALAN’20 presents ALACRITY’20, The Photography Contest of DUCS.
